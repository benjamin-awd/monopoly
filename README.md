## Install
Monopoly is a pip-installable Python package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/monopoly-core) under the name `monopoly-core`.

Since Monopoly uses `pdftotext`, you'll need to install additional dependencies:

```sh
apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config ocrmypdf
```

or

```sh
brew install gcc@11 pkg-config poppler ocrmypdf
```

Then install with pipx:
```sh
pipx install monopoly-core
```

## Usage
Monopoly runs in your terminal, allowing you to extract, transform and write bank statements to a CSV file.

To list commands and options:
```sh
monopoly --help
```

You can run it on a single statement
```sh
monopoly src/monopoly/examples/example_statement.pdf
```

or multiple statements
```sh
monopoly ./statements
```

If you need to run monopoly on a password protected file, ensure that passwords are set in the .env file:
```sh
cp .env.template .env
PDF_PASSWORDS=["password1","password2"]
```

Monopoly can also be run as a Python [library](src/monopoly/examples/single_statement.py):
```bash
python3 src/monopoly/examples/single_statement.py
```

## Features
- Parses PDFs using predefined configuration classes per bank.
- Handles locked PDFs with credentials passed via environment variables.
- Supports adding OCR for image-based bank statements.
- Provides a generic parser that can be used without any predefined configuration (caveat emptor).
- Includes a safety check (enabled by default) that validates totals for debit or credit statements.
